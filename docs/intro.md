# Yearn Internal Docs

This site centralizes reference material, runbooks, and onboarding context for contributors who already have access to Yearn infrastructure. Everything here is meant to remain **internal only** and assumes readers are under NDA.

Use the left sidebar to jump to specific topics:

- **Access control** explains how the site remains private and how to rotate credentials.
- **Local development** covers cloning, running the dev server, and validating gated builds.
- **Deployments** documents the CI/CD flow for both preview and production releases.
- **Writing playbook** captures conventions for adding or updating docs.

If you find gaps or outdated information, open a PR in this repo or ping #internal-docs in Slack.
